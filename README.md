# Linear-Priority-Queue
Implementation of a priority queue called LinearPriorityQueue using a doubly linked list as the underlying linear data structure to store the contents. 
Also, there is a program, PriorityQueuePerformanceTester.java, that tests the empirical running times of my insert and removeMin methods over a wide range of
priority queue sizes.
